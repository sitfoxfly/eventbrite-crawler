Event planners have gone beyond just meeting the events’ objectives, but constantly seek means to bring new, bold and unique elements into each of their creations. As they continue to innovate and deliver unforgettable event experiences, we also observe the emergence of game-changing event technologies across the spectrum in response to these prevailing needs. Considering the crucial role that technology plays in the event industry, Avenevv introduced Event Tech Show (ETS) as the first event technology exhibition organised in Asia Pacific, in conjunction with our commercial launch. Through ETS, we hope to showcase the latest and most inspiring event technologies across the world to event planners, agencies and any event enthusiasts in Asia Pacific.

Gaining insights into the different event operational challenges, as well as use cases of how technology could be a solution in response to these challenges, is the first step for us towards greater efficiency in event planning and execution.

It is only the beginning.

Believe it or not, he's spent 20 years in the entertainment industry - conquering television, film and the stage - and is primarily known for keeping locals humored at the now defunct Boom Boom Room. After several years of cracking relentless jokes, performing lip-synching sets, doing traditional Indian dance, and getting jiggy with hunky go-go boys, we still haven't had enough of Kumar. Besides this local legend's entertainment talents, he is also admired for his bravery to speak up for queer issues and those pertaining controversial local politics.Not forgetting his love for poking fun at all things taboo in Singapore, Kumar never fails to humor us with his quirky racial and sexual observations... And the best part is, he always manages to get away with his comments from local authorities. You might disagree with us, but we believe that Kumar will always be a prominent voice for all Singaporeans regardless of race, gender and sexual orientation. --- Doors open at 7pm, show begins at 8pm.
