Event planners have gone beyond just meeting the events’ objectives, but constantly seek means to bring new, bold and unique elements into each of their creations. As they continue to innovate and deliver unforgettable event experiences, we also observe the emergence of game-changing event technologies across the spectrum in response to these prevailing needs. Considering the crucial role that technology plays in the event industry, Avenevv introduced Event Tech Show (ETS) as the first event technology exhibition organised in Asia Pacific, in conjunction with our commercial launch. Through ETS, we hope to showcase the latest and most inspiring event technologies across the world to event planners, agencies and any event enthusiasts in Asia Pacific. For more information, please visit https://www.eventtechshow.com/ THE LIVING LAB CONCEPT Inspired by the Living Lab Concept, we work closely with our event sponsors and exhibitors to co-create and curate the best event experiences for you.

As the application of technology in the event industry proliferates, it is also rapidly shaping our event planning landscape by enabling organisers to automate tasks, streamline operations and increase productivity. Gaining insights into the different event operational challenges, as well as use cases of how technology could be a solution in response to these challenges, is the first step for us towards greater efficiency in event planning and execution. Panel Discussion 2: The Proliferation of Event Technology - Deepening Engagement and Driving Creativity Panelists: Mr. Alex Phua, Finance Director at Zouk Consulting Ms. Belinda Ang, Executive Director at thinkBig Communications Pte. Ltd Mr. Hugh Yii, Managing Director at Festival Square Circle Pte Ltd (Moderator) The Event Technology landscape has also been undergoing a significant metamorphosis itself. We have witnessed the emergence of event technology across different categories, formats and purposes, not only to make event planners' jobs easier and more seamless, but also to redefine event expectations and bring attendee experience to new heights. It is only the beginning. As event planners constantly seek means to bring new, bold and unique elements into each of their creations, the state of event technology would continue to evolve to help deepen attendee engagement, spark inspiration and drive creativity in the industry.

For the 12th year running, SimplyIslam.sg is happy to continue our annual Ramadan project where we provide food and financial help to about 250 needy families in Singapore in time for Eid al-Fitr. Watch a video of one of our recipients here: https://www.facebook.com/simplyislam.sg/videos/10155558736106264/ Our Partners - Muslim Kidney Action Association (MKAC) + Marine Parade CC + Darul Aman Mosque + Pasir Ris East Constituency In the early days, we organised the charity drive with only Muslim Kidney Action Association (MKAC). The organisation provides care and support to Muslims who are suffering from kidney failure and chronic ailments, and provides financial assistance to the families concerned. Over the years, we've collaborated with more organisations and groups, thereby increasing the Ramadan Charity Basket recipients! On top of MKAC recipients, we will also be helping recipients from Marine Parade Community Club. The CC supports needy recipients living in Marine Parade, and in collaboration with the Malay Activity Executive Committee (MAEC), the Marine Parade needy recipients will receive the goodies from the Ramadan Charity Basket! Additionally, we will continue to extend our hand to help some needy residents residing in Pasir Ris East CC, specifically, poor, needy and ailing residents of the rental flats along Pasir Ris Drive 3. These are some of the poorest people in the eastern part of Singapore, and reside in this heavily subsidised flats as they cannot afford their own homes. Many of them are old, ailing and unable to work due to their and and/or health conditions. Your contributions will go a long way towards giving them a semblance of normalcy, and a brighter, happier Eid Insha'Allah. We will also continue to support our neighbour, the Darul Aman Mosque. The Mosque is a unique landmark with its traditional 'kampung' design, strategically located in the heartland of the indigenous Malay community. It serves various local ethnic congregants and embraces the larger community of foreign residents in Singapore. Beyond religious classes and festivities, its outreach includes facilitating family services, in particular the under privileged. Once again, the poor and needy residents under the care of the Darul Aman Mosque will receive the goodies of the Ramadan Charity Basket. Giving food, Eid goodies and cash to over 250 needy families Eid, or Hari Raya, is a time when families cook delicious food, wear beautiful clothes and spruce up their homes in anticipation of guests. In Singapore, celebrations go on for a month long! Not all families can afford what the 'typical' Singaporean family enjoys and especially during Eid, it can feel even more lonely. The food provisions include rice, milk, sugar, dry foods and other basic amenities including Eid novelties, and some cash.

There are new developments in the markets. The stock market is going up, the S&P 500 has rallied 16% since last December and is on track to being the best 2 months since 2010! This rally has been fuelled by signs of a US-China trade deal and the “Jerome Powell Pivot” from a “hawk” to a “dove” in monetary policies. Will this trade deal happen? What are the implications on the stock market if it happens? Money market futures are now discounting no rate hike this year and one rate cut in 2020. This contrasts markedly with what was discounted just three months ago in early November 2018 when the Fed funds futures were discounting a 50bp rate hike in 2019 and no rate cut in 2020. What will happen? How will this development affect your portfolio? While the stock market is going up, the treasury yields have been moving in the opposite direction. This signals a brewing economic slowdown while the bulls are cheering on the business cycle to continue. Will this trend continue? The current situation shows the economic signs are worsening while the stock market is rallying but there can only be one winner in the epic crash between the bonds and the stock. Which side will win? What should investors do? Continue to ride the bull or get out of the market? I will answer all these questions and help you decide what you should do. Don’t miss this opportunity! Join me at my market outlook and get an expert’s view of the latest developments in the markets to be ready for 2019 and beyond! Robin Ho Q3 Market Outlook 2019 Things are getting simlilar to the previous financial crisis...

I will show you how to navigate the market conditions and share my views on the following: 1) My Singapore & Hong Kong portfolio that have achieved a whopping 28% gain! What are the stocks in SGX you MUST be watching? 2) How to prepare for the bear market? The RIGHT way to short and GAIN! 3) Will the Federal Reserve raise interest rates in 2019? How to take advantage and which markets will be greatly affected? 4) The vast majority of investors will be caught by surprise when this bull market finally comes to an end. How can you start preparing your current portfolio? 5) Undervalued stocks that no one is looking at! 6) Why do you need to be watching China? Revealing MEGA Trends that will shift the markets for the next 5 to 10 years! 7) The state of the US market! Should you join the rally? Which industry to target and profit from the collapse? And Much More! The strategies I'll share in this Market Outlook will not only inform but transform you into a better trader and investor as well.

Believe it or not, he's spent 20 years in the entertainment industry - conquering television, film and the stage - and is primarily known for keeping locals humored at the now defunct Boom Boom Room. After several years of cracking relentless jokes, performing lip-synching sets, doing traditional Indian dance, and getting jiggy with hunky go-go boys, we still haven't had enough of Kumar. Besides this local legend's entertainment talents, he is also admired for his bravery to speak up for queer issues and those pertaining controversial local politics.Not forgetting his love for poking fun at all things taboo in Singapore, Kumar never fails to humor us with his quirky racial and sexual observations... And the best part is, he always manages to get away with his comments from local authorities. You might disagree with us, but we believe that Kumar will always be a prominent voice for all Singaporeans regardless of race, gender and sexual orientation. --- * 18 Years old and above. * STRICTLY no exchanges or refunds on tickets. * Seating arrangements are pre-allocated at random. * Number of seats sold online are final * For group seating, purchase your tickets in the same transaction or under the same name/email address. * Seated tickets usually sell out in advance, purchase your tickets online to avoid disappointment. --- ADDRESS: 20 Upper Circular Road The Riverwalk #B1-01/06 Singapore 058416 PARKING: - The Riverwalk Multi-Storey Car Park - URA Open Car Park at Carpenter Street and Upper Circular Road (Free parking after 10:00pm) -- bryan@canvasvenue.sg +65 8125 0166"

While we often talk about the differences across valuation models, we seldom talk about what they share in common. In this seminar, we hope to emphasize the shared foundations of valuation approaches and how to bridge differences among them. The first part of the seminar will cover the discounted cash flow valuation, and the estimation issues that come up when estimating discount rates, cash flows and expected growth. In addition, it will look at value enhancement through the prism of discounted cash flow models. The second part of the seminar will focus on what we term the loose ends in valuation and follow up by looking at “difficult – to – value” companies across the spectrum (life cycle, sectors). The third part of the seminar will examine relative valuation, i.e., the valuation of assets/businesses by looking at how similar assets/businesses are priced by the market WHO SHOULD ATTEND: The mix of basic valuation techniques & applications provided in this seminar will appeal to a widely diverse audience. Equity research analysts, who are interested in examining alternatives to the multiples that they use or the linkage to discounted cash flow models. Corporate financial officers, who want to understand the details of valuation, either because they are planning acquisitions or are interested in value enhancement strategies for their firms. Analysts involved in mergers and acquisitions, who would like to acquire a wider repertoire of valuation skills. Portfolio Managerswho are interested in the effects of corporate restructuring on firm value, and the implications for portfolio management. Anyone interested in valuation WHY YOU SHOULD ATTEND: Value any kind of firm in any market, using discounted cash flow models (small and large, private and public) Value a firm using multiples and comparable firms. Analyze and critique the use of multiples in valuation. Value “problem” firms, such as financially troubled firms and start – up firms. Estimate the effect on value of restructuring a firm.

However, we all know that real estate investing is not easy – as these perks come with a huge price tag, and most investors don’t have the knowledge or experience to begin, not to mention in being successful. Now imagine this – what if you can invest in real estate without worrying about large capital requirements, mortgages, or even having an extensive knowledge of tenant and property management? It sounds too good to be true – but it’s possible, through an investment vehicle called Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT). And just like common stocks, REITs are traded on the stock exchange. Most people have heard of REITs. However, many are still not aware of its potential to grant you a very stable and passive income (about 8% per year if invested correctly). The objective of this programme will help you build a diversified Singapore REITs Portfolio for passive income. After this programme, you will go home with a concrete understanding and actionable plan on how to build a diversified Singapore REITs portfolio. What You Will Learn: Understanding Different Types of REIT Fundamental Analysis and Understanding Important Financial Ratio (Market Cap, PE Ratio, NAV, Gearing Ratio, Distribution Yield) Analyse the Quality & Dividend Sustainability of REIT (Tenant Mix, Occupancy Rate, WALE, Debt Expiry Profile) Risk Assessment of the REIT Valuation of the REIT (Undervalue, Overvalue or Fair Value) Entry & Exit using Technical Analysis Build a Diversified REITs portfolio from different sectors Know that the REITs Programme is Only the Beginning of a Fulfilling Investment Journey with Kenny and everyone at Adam Khoo Learning Technologies Group. The REITs programme is NOT a 1 Day ""touch-and-go"" programme. You'll be invited to inner-circle groups for real-time discussions and sharings of REITs investments and opportunities. The REITs Programme By Kenny Loh Will Include: Full Day Hands-on LIVE REITs Programme Conducted by Singapore's most renowned REITs Investor and Coach Comprehensive REITs Evaluation Checklist Exclusive REITs Scanner Software that helps you analyse any REIT in less than 7 minutes and to time the REITs in just 3 seconds! REITs Table of various Singapore REITs for easy analysis Access to Market Update and Sharings organised by Singapore's leading Fund Managers Join one of Singapore's largest REITs Community through a Facebook Secret Group, where you will learn, share and discuss live-market outlook and updates with me and fellow like-minded investors.

One of those things is to adapt a healthy lifestyle. Staying healthy can help you stay disciplined, improve your productivity and of course, keep you alive longer -- facts most successful entrepreneurs DO realize. We like to compare the entrepreneurial journey with the journey of an athlete: it is all about performance, setting goals, focus and structure. One thing we can learn from athletes is the way they structure their lives by adapting a balanced program between performing (training and tournaments) and recovery (rest, food and relaxation). Our panel will be discussing how a healthy lifestyle impacts the performance of an entrepreneur. We will discuss topics as: What can we learn from athletes? How does working out impact mental health? What is a healthy lifestyle? How do I know how healthy I live? What has food to do with performance? And obviously we want you to walk away with tips and tools to get started!
